title: Bridging Slack and IRC
---

Slack is an amazing tool. It has proved to be an invaluable resource for our
team by allowing a communication flow unlike any other. However, transitioning from
something as battle-proven as IRC can be a hard task.
[slack-irc](https://github.com/ekmartin/slack-irc) aims to help smoothen this
transition by letting you mirror channels on both ends.

This can be especially useful for communities making use of recent
tools like [slackin](http://rauchg.com/slackin/) to create Slack teams with thousands of
members. Many of these already have thriving IRC channels, and connecting them
could hopefully result in a merging of communities. It's currently being used for
[socket.io's Slack](http://socket.io/slack/) and the [Reactiflux Slack](http://www.reactiflux.com/).

Using Slack's [Real Time Messaging API](https://api.slack.com/rtm) arriving messages are prepared, parsed and then posted
to the correct IRC channel. Vice versa, messages posted on IRC are 
forwarded to Slack, allowing for simple two-way communication. Since the Slack
messages arrive over WebSockets slack-irc doesn't need to listen on a port.

slack-irc supports running IRC commands on startup, and it's easy to set up the
bot in both password-protected and invite-only channels. Choosing what channels you want
to mirror is completely up to you, which opens for the possibilities of having for example 
a public support IRC channel connected to your Slack team without having to
worry about security issues.

To make it as simple as possible to set up, Slack's [Bot Users
API](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) is used. To know what channels to bridge
slack-irc requires a simple JSON configuration:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "nickname": "SlackBridge",
    "server": "irc.freenode.net",
    "token": "slack-bot-user-token",
    "channelMapping": {
        "#slack-channel": "#irc-channel",
        "private-group": "#other-irc-channel"
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

It also supports running multiple bots from one slack-irc instance. A full
configuration example is available in the
[GitHub README](https://github.com/ekmartin/slack-irc).
